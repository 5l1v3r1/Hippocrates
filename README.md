# JNF_NEAT

My Implementation of Kenneth Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen's NEAT (NeuroEvolution
of Augmenting Topologies, http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).

It focuses (in contrast to other implementations) on

- Speed - through modern and efficient C++14
- Clean Code - through constant ongoing refactoring and a deep care for aethetics
- Usability - through beeing able to be used without much knowledge of Neural Networks
